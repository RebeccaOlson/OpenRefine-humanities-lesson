For this lesson you will need **OpenRefine** (formerly Google Refine) and a
web browser.

Note: this is a Java program that runs on your machine (not in the cloud). It runs inside your browser, but no web connection is needed.

Open Refine can be downloaded from https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases/tag/3.1 [https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases/tag/3.1]

selecting “Extract…”. Name that directory something like OpenRefine.
- Go to your newly created OpenRefine directory.
- Launch OpenRefine
- Click the google-refine.exe (this will launch a command prompt window, but you can ignore that and wait for the browser to launch)
